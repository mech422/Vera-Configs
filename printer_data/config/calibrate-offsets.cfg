#        currently, the probe is at 203, 305 and IS workable by the hotend.

# [probe]
# pin: PG10
# #   Probe detection pin. If the pin is on a different microcontroller
# #   than the Z steppers then it enables "multi-mcu homing". This
# #   parameter must be provided.
# #deactivate_on_each_sample: True
# #   This determines if Klipper should execute deactivation gcode
# #   between each probe attempt when performing a multiple probe
# #   sequence. The default is True.
# #x_offset: 0.0
# #   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
# #   x-axis. The default is 0.
# #y_offset: 0.0
# #   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
# #   y-axis. The default is 0.
# z_offset: 0 # FIX TODO SAH -???
# #   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
# #   triggers. This parameter must be provided.
# #speed: 5.0
# #   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
# #samples: 1
# #   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values will
# #   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
# #sample_retract_dist: 2.0
# #   The distance (in mm) to lift the toolhead between each sample (if
# #   sampling more than once). The default is 2mm.
# #lift_speed:
# #   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
# #   samples. The default is to use the same value as the 'speed'
# #   parameter.
# #samples_result: average
# #   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
# #   "median" or "average". The default is average.
# #samples_tolerance: 0.100
# #   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
# #   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
# #   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
# #   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
# #samples_tolerance_retries: 0
# #   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
# #   samples_tolerance. On a retry, all current samples are discarded
# #   and the probe attempt is restarted. If a valid set of samples are
# #   not obtained in the given number of retries then an error is
# #   reported. The default is zero which causes an error to be reported
# #   on the first sample that exceeds samples_tolerance.
# #activate_gcode:
# #   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probe attempt.
# #   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This may be
# #   useful if the probe needs to be activated in some way. Do not
# #   issue any commands here that move the toolhead (eg, G1). The
# #   default is to not run any special G-Code commands on activation.
# #deactivate_gcode:
# #   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each probe attempt
# #   completes. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. Do not
# #   issue any commands here that move the toolhead. The default is to
# #   not run any special G-Code commands on deactivation.
